# honeycomb_task

The honeycomb_task folder contains all the python files used by run_task.py. We provide brief descriptions detailing the purpose of each:

### animal.py
- determines the animal's position using the tracking data it receives from Bonsai through a UDP port. 

### choice.py
- handles the storage of the animal's decisions in a pandas dataframe. 

### configuration.py
- handles the generation and loading of the configuration file, which contains the robots ip addresses and port numbers. 

### create_path.py
- pseudo-randomly picks the next platform locations, and calculates the paths needed for the robots to move to those positions. 

### move_tracking_files.py
- moves and copies the tracking and behaviour files into short and long-term storage at the end of each trial. 

### platform_map.py
- generates the maps, and handles their loading. 

### robot.py
- defines the Robot and Robots classes, which store all necessary information about the robots: each robot's id number (1, 2, or 3), ip address, port number, position, orientation.

### send_over_socket.py
- sends the commands generated by create_path.py to the robots.
